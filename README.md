# Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem Solver

This is a Python implementation of the multiple choice knapsack problem (MCKP), a generalization of the classic combinatorial optimization problem, where the set of items is partitioned into classes. This solution implements a greedy algorithm described in: http://www.diku.dk/~pisinger/94-25.ps. The basic premise of the algorithm is to first find the LP-undominated classes that consist of only the items that aren't dominated by other items in the same class. Then starting with a solution that chooses the lightest item in each class, items are greedily swapped into the solution iteratively by choosing the available item at each step with the largest slope, where the slope is a measure of the profit-to-weight ratio obtained by choosing that item instead of the current choince in that class. The algorithm terminates when adding the item with the largest slope would bring the current weight above the capacity. If the terminal weight equals the capacity then the solution is an optimal objective value to MCKP. Otherwise, the greedy solution can be used as the starting point for a dynamic programming algorithm based on the concept of an expanding-core (not implemented). However, it can be shown that the number of changes to the greedy solution that are needed to find the optimal solution should be relatively small.
